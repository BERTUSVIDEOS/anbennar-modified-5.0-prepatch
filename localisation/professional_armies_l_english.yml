Many would consider it an ideal location for a young [Root.Heir.GetTitle] to spend [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] formative years, given its centrality to certain key matters of state, and the forthright character of its attendees. However, others would disagree, and suggest that military matters may be a misguided or even harmful priority to take. "

 PA_events.5.t: "The Professional's Due"
 PA_events.5.d: "There is a disagreement that has come to our attention, between the quartermasters and soldiers, about the pay that the soldiery are due under certain conditions of their contracts. In the past, soldiers' pay could be spotty, and so their service could be as well. However, in these more modern times, since we have embarked on the professionalisation of our army, expectations are higher. This is only a dispute about a certain portion of the pay; there is no question of revolt or mass desertion. Nonetheless, we should be conscious about the impact that our actions can have on an increasingly educated and cohesive class of military professionals."
 PA_events.5.a: "Accept the soldiers' position this time"
 PA_events.5.b: "Concede nothing"
 PA_events.5.c: "Negotiate a principled compromise"
