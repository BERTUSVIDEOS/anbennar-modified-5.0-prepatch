 Y26_march_north_title: "March North"
 Y26_march_north_desc: "Sziangnu occupies a strategically important position on the Yanhe river. Controlling it would allow us to control the entire river. The lands around the city would serve well as a base for further expeditions northwards. While this campaign is happening, state agents will begin working on preparing a small naval expedition to Daengun; this will not require the central government's attention beyond approving the venture. . "
 
 Y26_bulwark_in_the_north_title: "Bulwark in the North"
 Y26_bulwark_in_the_north_desc: "Who could forget the bird-riders? They have menaced Yanshen for many, many years through brutal, wide-reaching raids. It has only gotten worse after the Faceless Queen united the tribes and directed their internecine aggression outwards. A bastion to watch for further raids will protect Yinquan well into the future. A few forts have already been built for that purpose, they just need to be improved upon. When that is complete, it would be an apt time to see how the expedition fleet has fared."
 
 Y26_the_march_on_mulim_title: "The March on Mulim"
 Y26_the_march_on_mulim_desc: "The Mulim forest is traditionally part of Yinquan. There can be no other stewards for its woodlands. Even though the Divine Call dynasty have been able administrators, their presence only divides our homeland. No longer! Their dynasty can be allowed to exist, but the state that it rules needs to be destroyed - see to it. The woods will provide a good jumping point to any greater acts."
 
 Y26_reuniting_our_woods_title: "Reuniting our Woods"
 Y26_reuniting_our_woods_desc: "With Mulim fully incorporated into our state, it would be fair to say that Yinquan now has the power to properly assert itself across Yanshen. In a land divided by fragmentary warlords, being able to unite even a small corner grants our state a vast advantage. The world awaits!"
 
 Y26_reunion_of_siblings_title: "Reunion of Siblings"
 Y26_reunion_of_siblings_desc: "Before the Day of Ashen Skies, Yinquan was part of Kohai. The relationship was akin to a mother-daughter relationship. Now that we have grown larger, it has become something of a sister-sister relationship - resurrecting these old ties in a new fashion will aid the state considerably."
 
 Y26_suzerainty_of_the_yanhe_title: "Suzerainty of the Yanhe"
 Y26_suzerainty_of_the_yanhe_desc: "The capture of Tianlou is paramount to hegemony over the Yanhe. Nearly all trade in the region passes through the Jewel of Yanshen, and while campaigning to the city we can capture the rest of that trade - the wealth inherent to such a monopoly should be obvious. Of course, there are rumors of a terrible truth behind the venerable High Temples... but that can be investigated after Tianlou is conquered!"
 
 Y26_dominance_in_the_north_title: "Dominance in the North"
 Y26_dominance_in_the_north_desc: "No more games! Northern Yanshen is subject to Yinquan only, from the Mulim forest to the Jewel to even the venerable Yanhe - they all bend the knee!, we have become a major player in the chessboard of Haless, perhaps not on the level of the Command or even the Raj, yet formidable to any lesser! It is about time to move south..."
 
 Y26_the_city_of_shrines_title: "The City of Shrines"
 Y26_the_city_of_shrines_desc: "Tsingchunquan is but a glimmer under the shadow of vastly more opulent cities. It is unlikely that it will ever reach the heights of Tianlou or even Feiten, for they vastly outnumber us. Instead, this city ought to have its own claim to fame: Shrines. It needs more."
 
 Y26_the_land_of_a_thousand_shrines_title: "The Land of a Thousand Shrines"
 Y26_the_land_of_a_thousand_shrines_desc: "Through continual economic growth and an influx of plunder, the Mulim forest has flourished. The entire forest is now known as the land of shrines, rather than Tsingchunquan. Hundreds of shrines dot the landscape, laden with tribute for the Huli-Jing; let it become thousands!"
 
 Y26_maidens_in_the_government_title: "Maidens in the Government"
 Y26_maidens_in_the_government_desc: "Of course the Maidens of Liho will be granted a voice in the government. Have they not earned it? By guiding the faithful (and assisting in exerting control over them) the shrine maidens have done a considerable job in assisting Yinquan. Now, they jointly petition for the privilege to do it better - to formally represent the Huli-Jing in governmental affairs. It is an easy decision."
 
 Y26_lihoism_ideals_title: "Lihoism Ideals"
 Y26_lihoism_ideals_desc: "Liho's maidens have managed to establish themselves on every level of the nation from spiritual to political. The dominant religious strain of the Righteous Path in Yinquan is a particularly fox-reverent sect known as Lihoism, named in honor of the maidens who labor to spread its principles. It is time the maidens be given what they truly desire. Yinquan's current government will cease to exist, and instead be replaced by a faithfully Lihoist theocracy. The aristocracy might complain, but the matters of the spirit care little for worldly power."
 
 Y26_enlightenment_title: "Enlightenment"
 Y26_enlightenment_desc: "Our control of the Maidens of Liho affords our state some degree of influence over the Righteous Path community. Whatever we dictate can be made common religious dogma. In this circumstance, it is about enlightenment - the enlightenment of the self through the careful, thoughtful detachment of mortal qualms. It is only in this state that one can act at their best, for it is only here that one can be unburdened by what happens around them. Naturally, spreading this doctrine to the common folk will help lessen their objections to our state doing what it needs to."
 
 Y26_the_righteous_pilgrimage_title: "The Righteous Pilgrimage"
 Y26_the_righteous_pilgrimage_desc: "The hotsprings of Yinquan are famed for their comfort and accessibility. What if they were also famed for their ability to rejuvenate the chi of those who partake in them? Should we have the right contacts in the Xia, word could potentially spread of the mystical regenerative properties of these hotsprings, potent enough to justify a proper pilgrimage route. With tolls, of course."
 
 Y26_peasant_relations_title: "Peasant Relations"
 Y26_peasant_relations_desc: "Lanjinhui is constantly looking for allies to secure their flanks, even if they currently hold the advantage against Jiangdu. Siding with impotent peasants is not an easy feat, but it is an unfortunate reality best set aside for now. They need allies, and so do we - the rest can be settled later on.."
 
 Y26_seizing_control_title: "Seizing Control"
 Y26_seizing_control_desc: "Though ostensibly a republic of equals, it is an open secret that Lanjinhui is ruled by a shadow government, the Nincishi. To have control of the Nincishi is to rule Lanjinhui. We have been equal partners on the world stage for some time now, but this does not reflect our growing grace and power. We would never openly act against our long-time allies. Instead, we will use their own council against them - installing a few friendly agents will bring them to see the value of Yinquan's patronage."
 
 Y26_scheming_vulpines_title: "Scheming Vulpines"
 Y26_scheming_vulpines_desc: "Through the timely assistance of the Huli-Jing (well versed in trickery of all sorts), the Nincishi has been entirely brought under the control of Yinquan agents! The guile of these fox-women spirits is not to be underestimated. This control of Lanjinhui affords us the right to dismantle their government and integrate it into the greater Yinquan administration. It's about time."
 
 Y26_across_the_spear_sea_title: "Across the Spear Sea"
 Y26_across_the_spear_sea_desc: "Daengun lies on the other end of the Spear Sea. They were forced into isolation from the continual pressure of the bird-riders who menace their borders. Even though they are but a (relatively) short ship's trip away, all of Yanshen had more pressing matters than reconnecting with their lost brethren. Now, the Huli-Jing have whispered to us of their sisters in Daengun, the legalistic Gumiho. We have a duty to reconnect."
 
 Y26_the_shuvuushi_threat_title: "The Shuvuushi Threat"
 Y26_the_shuvuushi_threat_desc: "All things considered, there really are very few things separating us from Daengun, both geographically and politically. However, these problems make up for their number in their magnitude. The Shuvuushudi bird riders make nearly all land travel impossible, for their carnivorous birds can waylay just about anything they come across. Since sea travel is not desirable, we have only one option: pacify the entirety of the northern lands. Culling their birds will see the Shuvuushudi rendered impotent forever."
 
 Y26_trained_eyes_on_the_western_dragon_title: "Trained Eyes of the Western Dragon"
 Y26_trained_eyes_on_the_western_dragon_desc: "The Yanshin league lies to our west, but they are irrelevant in the scale of things. Our greatest foe is the would-be hegemon of Bianfang, the White Dragon, the domain of the tyrant. No words ought to be spent on singing their praises. Their state must be cast down and obliterated, regardless of what it costs to cast their kingdom to oblivion."
 
 Y26_establishing_the_shrine_of_hundred_thousand_lanterns_title: "Establishing the Shrine of Hundred Thousand Lanterns"
 Y26_establishing_the_shrine_of_hundred_thousand_lanterns_desc: "The one thing that truly establishes the certainty of faith is scale. If our faith in the Huli-Jing is insufficient, then we will be doomed to stagnation as our gifts do not grow to match the grace of our patron. There is a solution: A shrine of impossibly large scale shall see us proven sufficiently dedicated for a long time into the future. A hundred thousand lanterns (or enough to seem that way, at least) will be lit in a complex which will stretch for miles around. There will be nothing like it in all of Yanshen - no, in all of Haless! "
 
 Y26_dragon_tamed_title: "Dragon Tamed"
 Y26_dragon_tamed_desc: "The symbolic value of Bianfang's capture cannot be overstated. Tearing up the dragon-headed banner of our grandest foe represents the triumph of the fox over the dragon; the supremacy of Yinquan along the Yanhe; the unification of Yanshen under one banner. With the region beaten or governed into submission, the time has come to rebuild. War has defined the region for too long. What will become of it when it can be dedicated to peace?"
 
 Y26_flow_of_wine_title: "Flow of Wine"
 Y26_flow_of_wine_desc: "The speciality rice wine of Yinquan, Mijiu, has become hegemonic in its popularity across Yanshen for obvious reasons. Many inferior replicas have appeared all across the country, for the current production of Mijiu is simply insufficient to keep up with demand - even the Huli-Jing grow thirsty! More must be brewed, for all in Yanshen must have their fill and the Huli-Jing triple besides!"
 
 Y26_the_rice_quota_title: "The Rice Quota"
 Y26_the_rice_quota_desc: "Obviously the state takes a share of rice harvests. It is not only a helpful way to tax peasants who cannot spare their labor, but it has another benefit: Rice wine, provided directly from the state to the thirsty stomachs of the Huli-Jing. It will be to everyone's benefit to increase the amount of rice produced. New harvest methods and farming techniques have been pioneered in recent years. Perhaps employing those will increase the output of the farmers and in turn increase the goods we can tax?"
 
 Y26_pleasing_the_huli_jing_title: "Pleasing the Huli Jing"
 Y26_pleasing_the_huli_jing_desc: "There is an unfathomable amount of alcohol making its way through our realm, enough to draw the envy of even the most inebriated dwarf. As arranged through the rice quota, much of it goes into the hands of the state. The Huli-Jing have had an insatiable thirst for alcohol, but perhaps it is only insatiable because they have not had enough of it. We will turn over this grand stockpile to the foxes!"
 
 Y26_rebirth_of_our_saviour_title: "Rebirth of Our Saviour"
 Y26_rebirth_of_our_saviour_desc: "With the temples destroyed and the estranged Gumiho and Holi-Jing reunited, the great Huszien might finally be brought back into existence. It seems as if her very existence was shattered into myriad fragments, taking the forms of the fox spirits we know now. By bringing them all together into a great hall and performing the correct rituals, Huszien might finally be brought back onto Halann. The mistake of an era, undone!"
 
 Y26_trade_along_the_jellyfish_coast_title: "Trade Along the Jellyfish Coast"
 Y26_trade_along_the_jellyfish_coast_desc: "There is nearly nothing like seeing the Jellyfish Coast by night, watching the countless underwater lanterns swim by with ethereal elegance. The only thing to improve the scene is the carefully crafted hull of a merchantman laden with cargo. It is much more valuable, too. Securing this trade route will do Yinquan well. "
 
 Y26_the_blacksmiths_of_zyuiyut_title: "The Blacksmiths of Zyuiyut"
 Y26_the_blacksmiths_of_zyuiyut_desc: "The island of Ginjyu is host to a number of continent-famous blacksmiths. Though these smiths do not have a particular name, what they create does: the Moshugong swords. These legendary blades do not need their praises sung any more than they already have. By the guile of the Maidens of Liho and the clever trickery of the Huli-Jing, it should be possible to convince the blacksmiths of Ginjyu to make these swords for our own army. A lot of infrastructure and even more smiths will be necessary to staff an entire military, but the benefits for doing so are incredible."
 
 Y26_jellyfish_coast_taken_title: "Jellifish Coast Taken"
 Y26_jellyfish_coast_taken_desc: "Yanshen's coast lies under a single flag - Yinquan's. With most of the trade up and down the coastal ports going through land controlled by our state, we are able to reap the profits as the merchants do business with the ease of a single code of laws and regulations. As celebration, we will host a festival in Feiten where thousands of lanterns will be lit and released into the air. The sky will be lit by these lanterns in the same way that the sea is lit up by the jellyfish."
 
 Y26_mastering_the_chi_title: "Mastering the Chi"
 Y26_mastering_the_chi_desc: "True masters, those able to use chi to achieve the fullest abilities of the self, are rare. Many who are able to do so are greedy with their knowledge, as if teaching others would lessen their ability to channel their chi. Thankfully we are now able to fix this, for countless battles have created a sizable class of masters. With the help of the venerable Huli-Jing, it should not be very difficult to create an institution to ensure that this knowledge is not lost with the misfortune of a well-aimed bullet."
 
 Y26_the_xianjie_brethren_title: "The Xianjie Brethren"
 Y26_the_xianjie_brethren_desc: "We are friends with the monks of the Xia - their apprentices frequent our hotsprings even as pilgrims cross back and forth in the search of one holy site or another. That is why - the foxes whisper to us - we need to unify them if not by peace then by force. Friends cannot last in this cruel world, but subjects can; Think of it like this: It can only be by our hands that the monks of the Xia can be subjugated, yet still preserved. This must be done. It must be so."
 
 Y26_shrines_of_the_xia_title: "Shrines of the Xia"
 Y26_shrines_of_the_xia_desc: "Even though the Huli-Jing are the primary objects of our reverence, this does not mean that the other spirits of Haless are not worthy of worship! Soldiers and scouts moving through the Xia have yielded maps and reports of countless temples and smaller shrines, with nearly every one dedicated to a different patron or protector spirit. We must encourage the free worship of these other spirits so as to affirm our brotherly relationship with the monks of the Xia. "
