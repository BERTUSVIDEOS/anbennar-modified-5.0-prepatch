We had always heard Guhe was built on the ruins of a High Temple, but to have it so richly confirmed before our eyes is truly excellent."

esthili_academy_of_magic_tier_one_desc: "We have barely had the academy functioning for a single term and a new student has managed to *somehow* cause a damestear meteorite to crash land on the campus grounds. How they have done this is unknown, and the meteor appears to be tiny. The student is currently being interrogated by some of our top mages. Regardless, this is a terrific development, both for military and scientific applications. We have already dispatched our top minds to the Moonmount Library to look for tomes on how to expand upon this precious resource, if it is even possible."

esthili_academy_of_magic_tier_two_desc: "Incredible! It appears that one of the tomes in the Moonmount Library contained information about a damestear meteorite landing in this exact spot eons ago during the time of the precursor elves. According to the tome, this is an unnatural phenomenom caused by an ancient ritual, and only supposed to happen approximately once every ten thousand years. By slightly adjusting some parameters, our top mages have managed to cause the ritual to *duplicate* itself somewhat, and cause more damestear to land atop our existing damestear pile! Though the mages have also informed us that there will almost certainly be consequences for messing with such an ancient ritual."
