 flavour_haraagtseda.01.title:0 "To Tame a Land"
 flavour_haraagtseda.01.desc:0 "The clanging rhythm of hammers on scrap iron rang from the camp, a sea of patchwork hide and cloth tents through which weaved thousands of gnolls and their slaves. Stripe hided Fieldstalkers haggled and bartered with dark, shaggy furred Bonegnawers, all while bedraggled humans ran to and fro carrying out their master’s orders, ferrying raw materials and finished goods between groups of chattering gnolls.\n\nRozherg observed these countless small interactions as he patrolled the perimeter of the camp with a band of his most trusted warriors. He and his people had arrived in this land as exiles, fleeing the rumoured rise of a new Xhaz that would usher in a fresh era of persecution for the nomadic Kvangahga packs of the Salahad. They’d come to these rumour haunted lands with few hopes, expecting a wasteland filled with packs of lunatic gnolls, what they’d found was a veritable paradise by comparison. True this land was dry and rugged, and Izaba had warned him of the insidious influence of the hags to the south, but it was also rich in resources, populated by bickering clans that if his new mate’s pack was anything to go by, would fall into line once sufficiently cowed by a show of force. His people could make a home here, they would tame the feral packs around them and break the hold of the hags to forge a land fit for Kvanga herself.\n\nBut they couldn’t do it alone, his pack was not nearly large enough to control the entire savannah and he didn’t yet trust his Fieldstalker allies to not run right back to worshipping demons if left to their own devices. No, they would need help to tame this rugged land. He turned to one of his lieutenants “Send messengers to the west, call the faithful of Kvanga, tell them the Packmother has gifted us a land to call our own, we need only to claim it!”"

The surviving clan members gathered behind this holy warrior who proceeded to seek out and unite a coalition of other Bonegnawer packs, engaging in a string of guerilla campaigns against Grizaka's forces and earning the young warlord and his chosen weapon the moniker 'The Hammer of Kvanga'. Vastly outnumbered, Rozherg's pack was eventually driven from their homeland and forced to flee east where they soon met the enigmatic Izaba who's visions set them on the path to found the nation of Haraagtseda"
