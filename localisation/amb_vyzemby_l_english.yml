 repair_ananoma_title:0 "Repair the Ananoma"
 repair_ananoma_desc:0 "The Ananoma, once mighty fort cities of the halflings, have crumbled over the eons - worn down by wind, water, and warfare, they are now nothing more than ruins. However, with recent technological advancements our engineers believe we can restore them to their former glory and perhaps raise them to even greater heights. There will be costs to such a project, but the benefits and prestige of undertaking such a restoration would be great, and potentially give us significant clout among the folk of Fahvanosy."
 tear_down_ananoma_title:0 "Tear down the Ananoma"
 tear_down_ananoma_desc:0 "In our realm there can be found ruins of ancient fort cities, amazing examples of halfling architecture from their time on the mainland. These cities have been in ruins for ages, consumed by the jungle and worn down by time, and none but bandits and smugglers make use of them. They are a burden to our land, haunted reminders of times best forgotten, blocking space for any useful things that could be built there. We must tear down their remnants and clear the land for something useful. This could cause dissent among our halfling population, but the engineers believe the task logistically simple."
