Lorent stands tired yet victorious, due to the betrayal of their Damerian enemies by their imperial allies like the Grand Duke of Wex, whom now holds the imperial seat. The balance of power is broken and new challenges will arise, but will the dream of Anbennar (unity) finally be achieved or will Cannor once again descend into chaos?"

With so many orcs leaving for the surface, a power vacuum has been created in the Dwarovar. Goblins cast off the shackles of their former orcish slave masters, and dwarves from both surface and remnant holds seek to reclaim what they lost long ago. In the east, goblins carve out their domains in the Tree of Stone, in the shadow of the powerful hobgoblin Command."

Amidst the chaos, their human subjects start questioning their ability, while a new faith arises in the eastern sands. Will the Sun Elves manage to restore the Phoenix Empire? or a new empire will rise from the ashes?"

Native rule was reestablished under the Dhenijanraj, now a waning power whose vassals such as Rabaghekhur and Buhaanjirghal strain against their rule. To the north, Rajnadhaga stands against the invasion of the hobgoblin Command while the reclusive ogres of Azjakuma plot how best to exploit Rahen's chaos. Further east, Jianglusi, nominal leader of the Xia monks, and the Dragon King of Bianfang turn their gazes towards a battle for their very survival."

Between rumors that the famed elven homeland of Aelantir may be within reach after all, or realizations that most orcs leaving the Serpentspine during the Greentide also means an opportunity to reclaim the ancestral dwarven home, many entities are drafting their own plans. Mercenary companies, holy orders, refugees, trade companies and idealistic settlers are planning to head west, while dwarven champions start travelling eastward for the first time in generations..."
