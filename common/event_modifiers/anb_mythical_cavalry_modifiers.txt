####Mounts
##To add a new mount type, you MUST prefix it with: "mythical_cavalry_"
#your modifier MUST include "is_hussars_modifier = yes"
#to enable the mount you use "enable_mythical_cavalry = { mount = x }" where x is the name of the mount you put in your modifier name. 
#Example: if your modifier is "mythical_cavalry_drakon" you would use "enable_mythical_cavalry = { mount = drakon }"
