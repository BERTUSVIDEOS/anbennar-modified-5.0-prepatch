	#Elven administrations are marked with otherworldly brilliance, with an ancient and respected lineage that guarantees enamouration (or envy) from all races of the world.\nHowever, due to this elves can be seen as rigid and unchanging, very much favouring the status quo: after all, it has worked for thousands of years before so why not now? You have all the time in the world to obtain knowledge so what's the rush? 
	#Gameplay: A diplomatic country thats has a economic good backbone - but really backwards to new ideas and gets tired of war quickly

	#Elves have had many lifetimes to master the arts, including the art of war. Elven militaries are disciplined and swift, and if well-trained, can defeat an army many times its size.\nDespite this, due to the elven race's incredibly slow reproduction rate elves abhor the idea of war for it wastes too many lives - lives that can be spent in peace.
	#Gameplay: A very powerful and swift military that shines when its drilled and well-trained, however they replenish very slowly so its best to pick your battles

dwarven_administration = {	#bertus mod
	#"A dwarven-ruled country is all about no-nonsense hard work. Plots and diplomatic maneuvers hold little sway under dwarven rule: it's all about holding your ground (and sometimes, how deep your purse is).\nMost dwarves are stubborn to the core and hard to change, and capable of harbouring deep grudges, and while they make steadfast allies, if you make an enemy of a dwarf you will have an enemy for life."

Make them batter themselves upon your steel walls and give them a good battering in return with cannon and death.\nDwarven infantry is unrivaled in their sturdiness but not so much for the navies for the sea is home to no dwarf. It is a place where sky looms free and solid, and hard, steady ground is nowhere to be seen."

	#"Gnollish countries are an extension of the traditional matriarchal pack where kinship and blood is everything. Gnolls can withstand anything together, whether through scavenging and making ends meet to keeping unruly subjects undder paw: nothing will get in the way of the kinship within a gnoll pack.\nTo the outside world, gnolls are savage, man-eating slavers that makes them hard to trust; despite this, gnolls are no strangers to ruling over other races, and can reliably maintain an empire of subjects through fear alone. Oddly enough, gnolls are desperate for prestige, worldly goods and renown, craving opulence to the point of crippling their own pack if stagnant enough. What is certain, however, is that where there are gnolls, there are slaves... and slaves make the world go round."
	#Gameplay: play wide and conquer with safety that your lands are kept under good control. Tributary a lot of people and keep fighting and fighting for that prestige. Use trade to your advantage.

gnollish_military = {	#bertus mod
	#"In war offense is the only option. Gnolls are relentless, unforgiving and terrifying, with a trademark trail of consumed corpses following the wake of gnollish raiders and warbands. This kind of resourcefulness (yes, the man-eating kind) combined with their resilience for the wilds, allows gnolls to survive and maintain themselves in the harshest of conditions.\nGnolls abhor the idea of the sea, where their brutal savagery is held back by boats and the occasional boarding party and so they much prefer leaving those tasks for hired merchants and smugglers. After all, nobody likes the smell of wet dog."
	#Gameplay: hit hard and fast and always be on the offensive.

gnomish_administration = {
	#At its very core, gnomish states value organization and progress where ideas and theories flow freely (which are often seen as the highest marker of achievement). Despite their witty and prankster-like demeanor, in matters of state tight scrutiny is kept over all corners of gnomish goverment - which, while effective, may turn a country into a bureaucratic mess. While gnomes are seen as weaker than other races, gnomish administrations account for this by preferring pre-emptive measures, often dealing with issues and conflicts before they even occur through indirect or means of subterfuge.

gnomish_military = {	#bertus mod
	#Gnomish militaries rely on their technological ingenuity to outweigh their physical weaker limitations. In early history the gnomes forged their hierarchy with guerilla and skirmish warfare - however, since the advent of gunpowder, gnomish armies now rely on superior firepower in both cannon and rifle to defeat their foes.\nThis even stretches to matters of sea, where gnomish hulks have become infamous for their overwhelming amount of cannons and assorted artificery.
	#Gameplay: use superior firepower and conserve your units. If this was HOI4 they would be the epitome of Superior Firepower doctrine

	#Goblins governments rely first and foremost on the survival of the fittest, harkening back to their origin skulking in the darkness of Dwarovar. Strength is appreciated, sure, but ingenuity and intrigue, also known as smarts, is what makes a goblin stand out from the thousands of others like him. Succesful later goblin administrations are however marked with opulence and greed, with many industrial "smart" goblins who profit from vast killing machines and factories taking a slice of gold pie for themselves.
	#Gameplay: Use intrigue to cause chaos as a vanguard for your invasion. Develop a strong homeland and out-tech your enemies in battle.

goblin_military = {	#bertus mod
	#Goblin armies are marked by the use underhanded tactics such as burrowing tunnels for ambushes and explosive killing fields that make goblins prevail - and if that fails, the sheer overwhelming numbers will make short work of whoever remains. In a goblin's mind: the bigger boom the better, and as such goblin militaries often make use of unsafe but devastating inventions of war.
	#Gameplay: use your numbers early on, and be sneaky in a fight - ambush and outmaneuvre opponents. Later on, use firepower and blow em up!

halfling_administration = {	#bertus mod
	#Like their families, halfling administrations and tightly knit and communal - with many halflings returning home after a life of adventure abroad to impart their wisdom on the young. Succesful halfling countries are marked with the ability to make well with what you have (considering the history of halfling subjugation) and to work well with others around you (lest they put their hungry gaze on halfling soil). As such, trade is the livelihood for many halflings, with those cultivating farming tradition, their famous culinary arts or even the penchant for thievery and skullduggery to benefit themselves in the tall wide world.\n\nSadly, in the eyes of the tall world, halflings are seen as the laughing stock - and any would-be halfling ruler would need to fill shoes twice their size to prove themselves a conqueror.
	#Gameplay: Make do with what you have and be friends with everyone. Earn wealth with trade rather than conquest
		
}
halfling_military = {	#bertus mod
	#Halfling militaries are not known for much. They are weak, and have had little notoriety in war. As such many halfling states have had to rely on foreign mercenaries to do their work - in fact, many mercenaries have found stable careers working for halfling countries, and fight well to preserve such a lifestyle.\nIf push comes to shove however, halflings are anything but cowards, and for the right cause they can show outstanding courage and a will to keep fighting on where most men would falter.
	#Gameplay: horrible military but good in numbers and can recover morale fast if needed - but to be safe rely on mercs

harpy_administration = {	#bertus mod
	#Harpies care not for great cities or material possessions, after all: why build a house when you can simply fly to another one with such ease? What harpies do care about however, is a strong voice, leading to most administrations to centre around singular sources of power, traditionally in the form of the leading matriarch - who may or may not disregard the will of her advisors, lest they threathen her rule.\nTo their subjects, however, harpies care much less about direct rule and in fact promote their growth. Indeed, their vassals come quick to settling themselves under harpy rule, for their new mistresses care much less about the matters of the ground, and accept alternative forms of payment other than material tribute...
	#Gameplay: Find a strong leader and back them. Spread and play wide via powerful vassals.
		
}
harpy_military = {	#bertus mod
	#Due to their natural advantage of flight harpy armies are notoriously hard to catch and even to kill; and woe to those that do, for they would be harassed and ambushed every step of the way.\nOn the other hand, harpies make poor defenders, as the idea of standing your ground is foreign to a race that can simply fly away with no repercussions. While this may be a boon for survival, it also makes rallying harpy flocks after a defeat much harder, as their soldiers might be half a mountain a way by the time the warband calls.\n\nAt sea, harpies are very much a misnomer. They are creatures of the land and as such have no interest in open waters. What is to be said, however, is that their flying nature has become feared in boarding actions - with many a harpy navy becoming comprised of captured ships from their fallen opponents.
	#Gameplay: move fast and dont get caught. Outlast your opponents and make them chase you - and dont get caught as you'll be punished. Build your navy by stealing it from others

human_administration = {	#bertus mod
